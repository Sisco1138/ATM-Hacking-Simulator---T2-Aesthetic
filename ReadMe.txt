ATM Hacking Simulator - T2 Aesthetic

This Python program replicates the visual aesthetics and experience of the iconic scene from Terminator 2: Judgment Day where John Connor hacks an ATM. The program generates randomized alphanumeric sequences displayed in rows, mimicking the rapid code-scrolling effect seen in the movie.

Features

- Randomized Code Display: Each line of code features a randomized sequence of characters, adding to the chaotic, "hacking" vibe.
- T2-Inspired ASCII Art: Includes ASCII art inspired by the filmâ€™s style.
- User Interaction: Simple prompts and inputs guide the user through the simulation.

Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine (Python 3.6+ recommended).
2. Download the atm_hacking_simulator.py file from this repository.

Usage

1. Run the script in the terminal or your preferred Python IDE:

python atm_hacking_simulator.py

2. Follow the on-screen prompts, and immerse yourself in the experience!

Code Explanation

- Random Number Generation: Each lettered variable is assigned a random integer between 0 and 9 to simulate a dynamic, changing code.
- ASCII Art: The script includes ASCII graphics reminiscent of the scene.
- Random Code Display: Rows of random characters scroll across the terminal in rapid succession, creating the effect of code output in a movie-style hack.
- Final Prompt: After displaying the simulated code, the program prompts the user for a "PIN IDENTIFICATION NUMBER" and waits for the user to press ENTER to exit.

EXAMPLE:

PPPPP       IIIIIII       N     N
P   PP         I          NN    N IDENTIFICATION
P   PP         I          N N   N
PPPPP          I          N  N  N   PROGRAM
P              I          N   N N
P           IIIIIII       N     N
